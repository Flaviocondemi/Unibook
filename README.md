# UNIBOOK
Unibook is a software develped with java programming language, specifically using IntelliJ IDE. This project is the result of a final test of Software Engineering course at the university of Catania. The aim of the course was to build an application from the beginning, planning all software phases: from the ideation phase to the testing.
It's not properly a booking exam system because there is not an interation with a database. Therefore all datas remain only in runtime period!
Actually a step over could be add framework like **hiberante** to model database tables automatically.
If you want, here you can find the doc with the explanation in detail of the software with relative schemes.
